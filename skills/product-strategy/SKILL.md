# product-strategy — the Discovery Brief

First link of the discovery pipeline. It interviews socratically —never agreeing too early— to
separate the symptom from the cause, and closes by writing the Discovery Brief: the problem, the
evidence behind it, and up to three prioritized hypotheses.

## When it is invoked

| When | From / to |
|---|---|
| Discovery starts on a new opportunity or a problem with no prior research | Invocable on its own, over the loaded product node |
| The Discovery Brief is written | Exit toward `market-research` (`.claude/skills/market-research/SKILL.md`) — next station of the pipeline |
| The metric gate does not pass | Handoff toward `product-metrics` (`.claude/skills/product-metrics/SKILL.md`) — builds the North Star and the hypothesis metric before going on |

`product-metrics` is already installed in this pack: the handoff is real, not the dangling reference
to a metrics coach that the old pipeline used to name.

## The interview

It is run with the pressure method of `.claude/skills/grill/SKILL.md#method` — cited by path, never copied.

### Socratic: it does not agree

Faced with a proposal that already arrives shaped as a solution ("we need a tracking dashboard", "we
have to add notifications"), the answer is neither accepted nor elaborated: the counter-question that
separates the solution from the problem is returned.

> Bad: "good idea, what would that dashboard have?"
>
> Good: "that is a solution. What problem does it solve, and whose problem is it?"

It repeats until the answer names a concrete person's problem — never a feature.

### Evidence hierarchy

All evidence backing the problem is graded with the same hierarchy `grill` uses:
`behavior > data > claim > assumption`. "Several clients asked for it" (claim) does not weigh the
same as "3 out of 5 abandon checkout at the shipping step" (data), nor as a recorded session where
someone tries it and gets stuck (behavior). The lowest-grade evidence available is recorded anyway,
with its level next to it — it is not discarded, it is labeled.

### The metric gate

**With no metric, the problem is not clear.** Before accepting the problem as well posed, the
question is asked: which number would move if this were solved? If there is no answer, or the one
that shows up is a vanity metric (it changes no decision), the gate does not pass: it is said
explicitly and the work is handed off to `product-metrics` to build it before going on. Nothing
proceeds as if the gate had passed.

### Hypotheses, with a fixed format

Every hypothesis is written in this shape, without exception:

```
We believe that [segment] [does X] at [moment] because of [cause]; if that is true, we will see [evidence].
```

Generic example (e-commerce): "We believe that buyers who abandon the cart at the shipping step do so
because the cost only appears there; if that is true, we will see that showing the cost earlier
reduces abandonment at that step." A hypothesis without the "if that is true, we will see..." clause
is not a hypothesis: it is an opinion shaped like one, and it is returned with a counter-question.

**At most 3, prioritized by risk × impact** — never by order of appearance in the conversation. Risk:
how little is known about whether it is true. Impact: how much it moves the gate metric if
confirmed. A fourth hypothesis that shows up is recorded as a gap in the backlog; it does not enter
the list.

## The Discovery Brief

It closes by writing the deliverable as dated research of the loaded product node, in:

```
context/<YYYY-MM-DD>-discovery-brief.md
```

Dated, never overwritten — the same criterion the research folder of this repo already uses. The
path falls inside `content: */products/*/context/*.md` line of the brain's own `tree.md`: no new glob
and no resolver row are needed.

The Brief carries these four sections, in this order, each with its literal heading:

```
## Problem
## Evidence
## Metric gate
## Prioritized hypotheses
```

- **Problem**: the symptom separated from the cause, whose it is and why now.
- **Evidence**: each piece with its hierarchy level (`behavior`, `data`, `claim` or `assumption`)
  next to it.
- **Metric gate**: passed or not, and if it did not, the handoff to `product-metrics` left explicit.
- **Prioritized hypotheses**: up to 3, in the fixed format, ordered by risk × impact with the reason
  for the order.

## What this deliverable does not claim

The Discovery Brief does not replace the strategic layer that `prd` writes: it is dated research,
input for the next stations of the pipeline, never the living canon of the product.

## Destination

The skill resolves the destination before producing the deliverable, never after. Three cases,
two destinations:

- A product node is loaded: the deliverable goes to `context/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<name>.md` of that node.
- There is a brain, but no product node — no workspace yet, or a workspace without one: the
  deliverable is written to a file in the current folder.
- There is no brain at all: the deliverable is written to a file in the current folder.

With no product node, the file is written to the current folder anyway, and this line announces it:

the file is loose, nothing filed it, and no session scan will bring it back later.

The way out is named, never taken: `new-workspace` gives the work a workspace, `new-product` gives
it a product node. This skill never runs either — it may offer to move the file afterwards, but it
never creates that structure on its own.

This skill never asks which destination to use, and it never invents a third one.

The rest of the pack installs one skill at a time. Look at `.claude/skills/` first and offer only
the ones that are not there:

- `grill` — `npx skills add pedroromeroluna/ai-first-product-skills --skill grill`
- `market-research` — `npx skills add pedroromeroluna/ai-first-product-skills --skill market-research`
- `prd` — `npx skills add pedroromeroluna/ai-first-product-skills --skill prd`
- `product-metrics` — `npx skills add pedroromeroluna/ai-first-product-skills --skill product-metrics`

The whole pack at once: `npx skills add pedroromeroluna/ai-first-product-skills`. That command installs what the pack offers;
anything listed above it is installed by naming it.

The system these skills come from is AI First OS —
`github.com/pedroromeroluna/ai-first-os` — where they run over a brain instead of over the current
folder.
